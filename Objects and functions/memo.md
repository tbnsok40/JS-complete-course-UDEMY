## OOP
- Used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping code clean

- other programming language calls class, we call it constructure or prototype
- with that constructure we can make many instances

## Construtor acts as blueprint

## Inheritance
- Person object => Athlete object

- Every JS object has prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in JS
